shiny-server
===============

Adapted from [https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server/tree/master/vagrant/ubuntu13.04].

These scripts will start a Ubuntu 13.04 VM and provision it with (shiny-server)[https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server/].

The port 3838 will be forwarded to the host system.
Simply copying shiny apps into the `./apps` directory will make them available to shiny-server
